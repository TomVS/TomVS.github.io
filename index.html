        <h1>10 Essential Engineering Principles 📚</h1>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>1. Read the error messages thoroughly</h2>
            <p>
                Few habits pay off as consistently as actually reading your
                error messages. They're often written by the people who built
                the tools you're using — people trying to help you debug faster.
                Resist the reflex to panic and copy-paste the message into a
                search bar. Instead, slow down, decipher its meaning, and you'll
                usually find the exact hint you need to fix the root cause.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>2. Keep it simple</h2>
            <p>
                Every scalable system began as a small, working prototype.
                Overengineering early on is one of the easiest traps to fall
                into. Start simple, make it work, and only then evolve it. Lean
                designs are easier to test, deploy, and replace when needed.
                Complexity should be added consciously, not by accident.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>3. Stay curious — it's your superpower</h2>
            <p>
                Curiosity fuels growth in engineering. The best engineers never
                stop asking "why" and "how." They open unfamiliar files, trace
                code paths, explore design docs, and experiment with APIs just
                for the fun of it. That instinct to explore will quietly sharpen
                your instincts far more than any formal course.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>4. Tenacity — don't give up too soon</h2>
            <p>
                Debugging can be maddening, but perseverance separates the
                seasoned engineers from the rest. Break problems into chunks,
                test your assumptions, and keep iterating. It's astonishing how
                often the solution appears right after you almost quit. Tenacity
                builds confidence and deepens technical intuition.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>5. Don't trust AI blindly</h2>
            <p>
                AI tools can drastically speed up your work — but they also make
                mistakes in convincing ways. Treat them like clever interns:
                useful, but unreliable without supervision. Always review, test,
                and understand their suggestions before pushing them into
                production. Critical thinking is your safeguard.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>6. Define the problem before solving it</h2>
            <p>
                The fastest way to waste days is to misunderstand the real
                problem. Spend time asking clarifying questions, reviewing
                requirements, and validating assumptions. Once you pinpoint the
                true pain point, the scope shrinks and the path forward becomes
                clear. Great engineers are great problem framers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>7. Soft skills — or rather, "core skills"</h2>
            <p>
                Communication, empathy, and collaboration aren't optional extras
                — they're career accelerators. You'll need to influence
                decisions, manage expectations, and translate complex ideas into
                plain language. These "soft" skills often create more impact
                than technical brilliance alone.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>8. Communication across levels</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you're explaining a deployment issue to your team or
                presenting timelines to leadership, clear communication is
                essential. Adapt your language and level of detail to your
                audience. The goal isn't to sound smart — it's to be understood.
                Great communicators build trust effortlessly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>9. Impact evaluation and prioritisation</h2>
            <p>
                You'll constantly face competing priorities. The ability to
                assess what truly matters — by considering impact, risk, and
                trade-offs — defines mature engineering judgment. Learn to ask:
                will this make a noticeable difference? Doing fewer things with
                higher impact beats doing everything halfway.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="post-item">
            <h2>10. Always think about data</h2>
            <p>
                Data drives clarity. From diagnosing incidents to justifying
                roadmaps, evidence-backed reasoning builds credibility. Track
                metrics, gather logs, and measure outcomes. Data not only helps
                you make smarter decisions — it also helps you tell a more
                persuasive story about why your work matters.
